## Diversity and Equity Statement {-}

Our Faculty of Education embraces an inclusive learning community that respects and recognizes that we are enriched and strengthened by diversity including, but not limited to, ethnicity and national origins, language, gender and gender identity, sexuality, ability, age, socioeconomic status, and spirituality. We are committed to increasing the participation of people who have been historically and systemically excluded from higher education and welcome all who share this aspiration. We are committed to answering the Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. We are a campus that educates for and encourages respect, acceptance of others, inclusion and diversity, with one principal limit: acts that incite hatred, espouse or encourage bigotry, either implied or explicit, will not be tolerated.
