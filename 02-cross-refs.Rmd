# Course Toolset {-}

We will use a variety of tools in this course, as you might expect in a course about personal learning networks and using social media in education. One of the primary reasons for that is to allow opportunity for you to make your learning visible and to share it with the community, whatever that might look like for you. I recognize that you may be coming to this course for a variety of reasons, including as an elective for your Teacher Education program, but also as an elective in another program, for your own personal learning, or maybe because you heard about the series of courses that @edtechuvic offers.
