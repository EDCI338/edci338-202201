Diversity and Equity Statement Our Faculty of Education embraces an inclusive learning community that respects and recognizes that we are enriched and strengthened by diversity including, but not limited to, ethnicity and national origins, language, gender and gender identity, sexuality, ability, age, socioeconomic status, and spirituality. We are committed to increasing the participation of people who have been historically and systemically excluded from higher education and welcome all who share this aspiration. We are committed to answering the Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. We are a campus that educates for and encourages respect, acceptance of others, inclusion and diversity, with one principal limit: acts that incite hatred, espouse or encourage bigotry, either implied or explicit, will not be tolerated. Remote Access to Some University Services A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows users to access networks and services over a secure connection. Please note that some university services, including library access, may require you to connect to the library servers by VPN. To download and install the Cisco VPN software, please visit: https://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/internettelephone/remoteaccess/index.php MODE OF INSTRUCTION This course will be offered online. Activities will occur via various methods of access and may include: - participation in live video classes &amp; multi-media deliverables (whole group, small group, or pairs) - participation via Mattermost, blog posts, forums, editable online documents, email, text chat, and/or social media - observation or creation of text or multimedia files across a variety of platforms Please be familiar with the OIPC Cloud Computing Guidelines for Public Bodies and UVic’s Privacy resource and engage in any cloud-based tools only as it may be your personal preference as it is NOT required to complete this course. The course will be supported by a variety of communication tools including: Email, WordPress, Mattermost, video conferencing via Zoom etc., and social media platforms. Please note that online learners must connect to the any video classes from a dedicated learning environment (e.g., not connecting from public Wi-Fi at the beach); consider the video conferencing etiquette (e.g., mute your mic when not talking to minimize background noise, other individuals); and be aware of your video presence (e.g., the lighting is acceptable and your camera angle is not missing the top half of your head). Using a dedicated headset with microphone will also help to provide better audio. REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY AND CONNECTIVITY Students are required to have the following technologies and connectivity levels. ● Internet Connectivity - A "],["cross.html", " 2 Cross-references 2.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 2.2 Captioned figures and tables", " 2 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 2.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 2.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 2.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure!

(check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib).

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
