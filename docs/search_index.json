Those of you who have created your Learner Profiles in GitHub as of 4:45pm on Thursday have been invited as collaborators and should see an email in your inbox with the invitation. Once you are a collaborator, you will be able to add the Learning Pod label to your profile.. Week One - Wednesday, Jan 12 It‚Äôs good to see you starting to register your WordPress sites, signing up for GitHub (BTW, don‚Äôt choose a paid plan!), and submitting your first issue to the ‚ÄòLearner Profiles.‚Äô You can see others who have submitted their issues as well at this link. While you are there, you can click on your own issue and add a label to align yourself with a Learning Pod. Screenshot of adding a label to a Github issue Also, in the EDCI338 repository that you created in your own account, please go to ‚ÄòSettings,‚Äô then ‚ÄòManage access,‚Äô and click the green ‚ÄòAdd people‚Äô button and add me as a collaborator to your repository. My GitHub username is cmadland. Since the Learner Profile issues you created in the course repo are public to the course, we will use your own private repository to track your work and have assessment conversations. Manage access to a repository in GitHub. ‚ú® ProTip It is perfectly normal to feel a bit overwhelmed or intimidated at the beginning of a course. EDCI338 has a bunch of front-loaded set up in technologies, and that always takes time. Please be patient with yourself and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you need assistance. Week One (Jan 10-16) Hello everyone and thank you for joining this course! My name is Colin Madland and I will be your instructor for this Spring 2022 cohort of EDCI 338, Social Media and Personalized Learning. I am a PhD candidate in the Educational Technology area of the Faculty of Education, where I am researching assessment in higher education. You can learn more about me and my research on my personal website and follow me on Twitter. I live and work in West Kelowna, BC, on the traditional, unceded, ancestral lands of the syilx people and I am grateful to be a guest here. When I am not working on my reasearch, or my day-job at another BC university, I really enjoy riding my bicycle, cooking all sorts of deliciousness on my grill, and hanging out with my family, which includes my wife, 2 two sons, 1 daughter-in-law, 1 daughter, 1 son-in-law, and 1 grandson. Some people might include the fur-bearing beasts (a dog and a cat) in the ‚Äòfamily‚Äô category, I know they certainly do! I‚Äôm going to be honest with you (hopefully that isn‚Äôt surprising‚Ä¶) and perhaps a bit vulnerable. I‚Äôm teaching EDCI338 for the first time this spring, and the course requires a significant investment in learning to use some technologies that you and I both may not be entirely familiar with. There aren‚Äôt really any good ways to think deeply about social media without actually engaging in social media. That can be really challenging, especially in the midst of the ongoing dispruption of our lives due to COVID-19. Disruption can take many forms, from being physically sick with COVID, to having family members and friends being affected, to losing jobs, and on and on. As a result, it can be really hard to focus on learning. So, I want you to understand from the very beginning that it is my responsibility in this course to do whatever it is that I can to support your success. üíØ My commitment to you‚Ä¶ I am committed to helping you achieve success in this course, and I trust you to contact me if you have questions or concerns. I hope you will find that you are welcome to approach me through whatever media I‚Äôve published. Admittedly, sometimes I miss notifcations, but that is not on you. I encourage you to be persistent if you haven‚Äôt heard a reply after a day or so. Getting Going During this first week, it will be important to start getting comfortable with a couple of the tools we will use for the course. There is a WordPress Setup and a GitHub Setup page with instructions for how to get started with those two tools. It will be important for you to get started with these tools as they will be critical to your work in the course. I have created a poll to help us decide on a weekly meeting time, but for this week, let‚Äôs meet at 9:00am Pacific time in Zoom at the link that I sent in the announcement from Brightspace Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read the syllabus, which will be posted in Brightspace early this week. ‚úîÔ∏è Sign up for a WordPress site. ‚úîÔ∏è Register for a GitHub account. ‚úîÔ∏è Visit the course repo on Github and create a Learner Profile issue (click Issues to get going‚Ä¶). ‚úîÔ∏è Sign up for hypothes.is and join the edci338 private group. ‚úîÔ∏è Annotate the Course Details and Assessment pages with your questions, comments, concerns, or other observations.

Ultimately, you need to demonstrate to me that you have met the outcomes listed on the syllabus. In a course about social media and personal learning networks, that means you will have to demonstrate to me in your activities and in your reflections on those activities that you have, in one way or another, met the intended outcomes. Doing your work with that in mind will absolutely help you perform in the course. It also means that you will have to make your personal learning network interactions visible to me and to your fellow learners in the course. The way to do that is to tag your work in whatever platform you are interacting with edci338. The work you do will happen in two primary locations and some other secondary locations. Please see the Course Toolset for more details. The fundamental and core task in this course is for you to build and reflect on a Personal Learning Network (PLN) using modern networked tools. Your PLN will likely end up with two nodes by the time the course is complete. One node will be the network we build within this community of learners, while the other node (or maybe more) will be the professional connections you make outside the course. Hopefully, both nodes will persist beyond the end of the course, which is why it is critical that the work you do is NOT locked up in an institutional Learning Management System (LMS; Brightspace is the UVic LMS). Building Community Support This is an asynchronous online course, meaning that we don‚Äôt have any specific required meeting times. This can be a significant advantage for those who unable to meet at a particular time on in a particular place, but it can also contribute to challenges completing the coursework for those who prefer to work in more social contexts. We seek to strike a balance between learners working in isolation, and requiring on-campus meetings. To do this, there are three critical structures in the course: learning pods, weekly meetings, and assessment meetings with me. Learning Pods You will be provided a link to a password-protected page where you can sign up for a learning pod, which is a group of 3-4 learners who meet together regularly (ideally weekly) at a time that works for them. This time should be used to review the course materials and any questions that learners might have, and also to plan and organize work on the course assignments. Learning pods are intended to be your first line of support during the course. Weekly Meetings We will determine a time during the week that works for as many people as possible for a 1-hour meeting time with me. This meeting will not be required, but it is strongly recommended that you attend as many of these meetings as you are able. This will be a time to discuss the week‚Äôs readings, clarify questions about both the content and the logistics (what is due when and where) of the course. Assessment Meetings Each learning pod will be required to meet with me at least twice during the course. The first time will be within the first two weeks to ensure that you have been able to get set up with all the required tools and connected with a learning pod. The second required time will be prior to reading week to ensure that you are on track for the Major Project. Learning pods are also encouraged to book meeting times with me as needed. Community Contributions and Connections (30%) Throughout the course, you will be required to reflect on the work you are doing in relation to the topics of that particular week. This reflection will be in the form of blog posts on your own blog (either on opened.ca, or another blogging platform) and they will be due throughout the course. There are 8 prompts for you in the course and you will be required to respond to each of those. You will choose 2 to be assessed for grading as showcase posts (15% each for a total of 30%). Your 2 showcase posts will be polished for publication on your blog and should reflect a professional voice. Post Prompts (Reviewed in your Learning Pods) Your posts in response to each of the prompts will be in the form of one ‚ÄòWow‚Äô and one ‚ÄòWonder.‚Äô A Wow is anything from the week that caught your interest from the readings, videos, tasks, your PLN, or one of your fellow learners‚Äô posts. It should be something that you haven‚Äôt thought of before or maybe that you have changed your thinking about. A Wonder is something that you have a question about from the same sources. It might be something you thought wasn‚Äôt explained clearly, something that is counter-intuitive, doesn‚Äôt make sense, is muddy, or simply something you want to investigate further. Your Wow and Wonder posts can be brief (100-150 words) and in point form, but they must include a hyperlink to the artifact you are writing about and a brief reflection on why you chose that Wow or Wonder. Showcase Posts (2 @ 15% each) You will choose 2 of your Wow and Wonder posts and expand and polish them to be about 500 words. You should reference course artifacts and find resources not listed in the syllabus to inform and support your thinking about your Wows and Wonders. Set a goal for yourself of linking to at least 2 other learners in each showcase post. You are encouraged to diversify your interaction and reading of other learners in the community. You should find that these interactions lead to increased traffic on your own blog, which will provide opportunities to have your thinking supported, questions answered, and possibly new connections made. It is recommended that you comment on others‚Äô posts by including a link in your own post to the post you are commenting on. This will create a ‚Äòtrackback‚Äô on the original post, which is just like a comment. Make sure you check the comments on your own site because you will have to approve them before they are visible. You will see a notification in the side menu of WordPress when you have comments that need to be approved. Each Showcase post should: be about 500 words in length, include a featured image, include hyperlinks to relevant course materials and activities, include commentary on and hyperlinks to other EDCI338 learners‚Äô posts, a list of references including hyperlinks to cited work (use the style you are accustomed to) Suggested Prompts for Comments Please remember that these blogs are shared publicly, as are your comments. It is important to use your comments as a way to provide supportive, constructive feedback, to initiate a conversation, or to share connections. Keep your language positive, offer suggestions, and focus on the content of the blog post - discourse is encouraged. Examples of positive engagement include: My new thinking after reading your post is‚Ä¶ I agree with the idea of‚Ä¶ because‚Ä¶ I am wondering if you have read this article/website/book (share a resource link) I noticed that our thinking differs in this way‚Ä¶ A connection I made between your work and‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶ I really liked how you explained‚Ä¶and I am wondering if you can tell me more about‚Ä¶ Something I am wondering after reading your post is‚Ä¶ Major Project (40%) You will be working on the major project throughout the course and in collaboration with both a learning pod and also with the whole class. The end result of this work will be a polished e-book of resources for educators who want to learn about social media and building a PLN. For this project, you will be working in Learning Pods, a group of 3-4 learners working together to help each other succeed. Each Learning Pod will be responsible for researching and publishing resources about one social media tool that educators might use in their teaching. There is a preliminary list of tools on the toolset page. The platform we will use to create the resource will be GitHub, a tool specifically designed to enable remote teams to collaborate on complex projects. Git, the software that enables GitHub, was designed to aid the development of the Linux operating system. We will spend some time early in the course becoming familiar with GitHub and the terminology it uses. While this may sound intimidating, it is well within your capabilities to learn to use it. One thing you need to know about GitHub is that it makes everyone‚Äôs contributions visible to the whole community. We will all be working in the same space, and everyone in the class will be able to see what everyone else has contributed. Project Details You will work in your learning pods to complete the major project, which will be to create an online resource for educators wishing to learn about using social media tools to build a Personal Learning Network. Each Learning Pod will contribute an in-depth analysis of one networking tool that might be used in educational settings. The structure of each page in the resource will follow the topics and structure of the course, so you will be working on completing the major project as you progress through the course. Celebration of Learning (30%) Your final task in the course will be to tell me what you have learned. This will be one final post published on your blog in which you reflect on each of the course outcomes and how your work in the course contributed to meeting those outcomes. Your reflection must include references and hyperlinks to: - your own work in the course and an explanation of how your thinking was formed, - your colleagues‚Äô work in the course and an explanation of how their work informed your thinking, - course materials, including articles, videos, interviews, social media artifacts, etc. ‚ú® ProTip I STRONGLY recommend that you create this post as a draft at the beginning of the course and add to it throughout the course as we progress. It will be much more difficult to complete this post if you leave it until the end. An easy way to help yourself manage this is to create a set of outcome categories on your blog (outcome1, outcome2, etc) and apply those categories to the posts that meet those outcomes. Grading Standards Click here to read about the SOLO Taxonomy. "],["course-toolset.html", "Course Toolset Primary Tools Secondary Tools", " Course Toolset We will use a variety of tools in this course, as you might expect in a course about personal learning networks and using social media in education. One of the primary reasons for that is to allow opportunity for you to make your learning visible and to share it with the community, whatever that might look like for you. I recognize that you may be coming to this course for a variety of reasons, including as an elective for your Teacher Education program, but also as an elective in another program, for your own personal learning, or maybe because you heard about the series of courses that edtechuvic offers. Regardless of your reason for being here, you are welcome! It is important to note that we will be using multiple tools in this course, and I am aware that this can create challenges for people. While it is up to you to ensure that you have proper access to the information that you need, please ensure that you reach out to me if you have questions. These tools are central to the course content and it is literally my job to help you with this! Primary Tools These primary tools form the backbone of EDCI338 and are the core creation tools we will use. WordPress Instructions related to WordPress will appear inside blocks of this colour. WordPress will be our hub for EDCI338. The course hub is where I will post updates throughout the course and you are strongly encouraged to subscribe to receive notifications of updates using an email address that you often check. Additionally, you will sign up for and create your own WordPress site. It is on this site that you will publish your reflections on your work through the course. We have provided instructions for how to get set up on opened.ca. You may already have an ___.opened.ca website that you created for another EDCI course and you may use that one by simply adding an edci338 category to your posts. You may also use your own site through WordPress.com or another blogging tool, as long as the site publishes an RSS feed. The main caveat is that my ability to help troubleshoot your site may be more limited if you aren‚Äôt on opened.ca. GitHub A significant part of the work you will do for EDCI338 will be in the context of creating content using a collaborative tool. GitHub is a tool designed for the collaborative creation of software, but it can also be used for people looking to collaborate on text and multi-media documents. While GitHub may be unfamiliar to some of you, the workflow is not difficult to learn. - sign up with your uvic.ca email address to get a free upgrade. Secondary Tools The secondary tools are more topical in the course and will be the subjects of our explorations. Instructions related to secondary tools will appear inside blocks of this colour. An RSS Reader There are numerous feed readers available on the web, but two that I recommend are Feedly and, my personal choice, Inoreader. Both offer free plans with ‚Äòpro‚Äô upgrades, but the free plans should be more than adequate for this course. Feed readers allow users to aggregate updates, or feeds, from various sources, such as blogs or news websites. Unfortunately, the free tier of most feed readers doesn‚Äôt include the ability to subscribe to social media feeds, such as Twitter or TikTok. A feed reader can help you stay in touch with others in this course as well as receive notifications on my updates. The following are some possible social networking tools that we might explore in the course, depending on your interests.

While Github was created for teams to collaborate on coding projects, it can also be used for many other projects. Some of the language around interacting with Github might be new to you, but that is ok, it will seem foreign at first, but the whole point of you taking this course is to learn new skills, right?! I‚Äôm here to help. The first thing you might notice is that there are some weird punctuation marks in the raw text in Github. That is called Markdown, which is a way to tell web-browsers how to style text. The basics are super easy to learn, and they map pretty well to what you might do in a word processor. For example, in MS Word, if you want to indicate a heading, you put your cursor in the text, and choose the Heading 2 style. You can do the same thing in Markdown by simply adding two hashtags and a space before the text, like this‚Ä¶ ## Markdown Which shows up on the page like this‚Ä¶ Markdown Each heading level uses the corresponding number of hashtags. Heading levels # Heading 1 ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3 #### Heading 4 ##### Heading 5 ###### Heading 6 Styling text You can also style text as italics *italics*, or bold **bold**, and you can also stack codes so bold italics ***bold italics***.
