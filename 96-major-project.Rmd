# Major Project {-}

Your task in for the project will be to collaboratively create a reflective resource as you build a professional PLN in a particular social media platform. We will add to the project week-by-week and will act as each others' peer reviewers as we go so that the final result after the next 6 weeks is a user-friendly resource for others seeking information on particular social media platforms.

## Step One {-}

The first thing we need to do is to have each Learning Pod 'sign up' to a particular social media platform. This will be the platform that you use as the basis for your Final Project. The structure of the project is such that we can only have one group working on a particular social media platform, so it will be first-come-first-served for the sign up. GitHub will track the specific time that issues are added and will display the issues in reverse chronological order on the issues page.

### How to Sign Up {-}


```{block, type='protip'}
#### âœ¨ Follow These Steps...{-}
- Create an new issue in the [Course Repository](https://github.com/cmadland/edci338-202201) (not a learner profile, you'll have to click the 'Open a blank issue' link) and add:
    - each of your Learning Pod members as assignees
    - me as an assignee
    - your Learning Pod label
    - a new label identifying the social media platform you are signing up for (make sure it isn't already taken).
    - ~~the 'EDCI338 Major Project' project.~~ Looks like I will have to do that bit.
```

There are obviously many social network platforms to choose from, some of which are more popular than others. If another pod claims a platform that your pod was hoping to claim, in addition to adding a new label for your second-choice platform, add a comment in your issue and a link to the issue that has already claimed your first-choice platform. We *might* be able to differentiate your projects enough to allow two groups to explore a single platform. No promises.

Now that you have chosen a social media platform, it's time to get organized
